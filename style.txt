Stylistic Choices

I did essentially all of my formatting and styling externally in my
CSS file instead of in the HTML itself in order to keep things clean
and consistent throughout the website.

Some things in the CSS file:
- I created a color palette at the top that was referenced throughout
    the file in order to keep a consistent green palette.
- I also imported a font family to make the text more visually appealing 
    as well as keep it consistent.
- I formatted the images I added to be dynamic with the webpage window.
- I formatted the tab naviagtion at the top of the webpage to be sized
    based on the window but have a fixed position so as to be reachable 
    when scrolling down the webpage.
- For both the navigation tab and the projects on the projects page, I 
    formatted the boxes to highlight when hovered over.
