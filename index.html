    <h1>Welcome, I'm Anya!</h1>

    <h2>This is my new personal website</h2>

    <div id="about_me">
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Anya Wild and I'm a Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience
            major at Northeastern University. I'm from Seattle (or somewhat close to it)
            and now I live in Boston for school. I love to walk around the city (especially
            near the river), hangout with friends, make playlists, go hiking, and go to cycling
            classes. My favorite color is green (as you can probably guess) and my favorite food
            is any type of pasta.
        </p>
        <p>
            Career-wise, I'm interested in the intersection of technology and neuroscience, 
            especially in figuring out how data science can aid in neurodegeneration research.
            In fact, I worked as a Data Manager at Massachusetts General Brigham's Neurological 
            Clinical Research Institute for my first co-op, where I cleaned and reported on data 
            from 3 studies and over 50 sites across the United States (more on that in 
            'Data Management Co-op').
        </p>
        <p>
            But what is this website? Well, it started as a homework assignment for my DS4200 
            class (Information Presentation & Data Visualization), and now it's my own little 
            personal website. I'm going to link a bunch of projects (although a fair number will 
            only be available upon request), some contact information, cool pictures, and I'm 
            not really sure what else. Stay tuned!
        </p>
